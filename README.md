# relaycontrol

Version 0.1

## Details
The purpose of writing this code snippet was for an Arduino based Xboard, which I needed for some home automation 
projects to control various relays. I wanted a basic web UI so I could activate the relays.

The basic framework is here, and you can change the web format to suit your needs.

Some of the code format was borrowed from dfrobot.com. Details of the Arduino based board and code samples can
be reviewed at the following URL:
